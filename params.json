{"name":"Plotter","tagline":"a simple function plotter based on php","body":"### Plotter\r\nis an online function plotter based on PHP (and a tiny bit of JavaScript). Use it to draw curves of many mathematical\r\nfunctions (or expressions) as an image in jpeg, png or gif format. It is simple to use and produces nice graphics\r\nby default but can do some quite complex graphs with a bit of an effort. At the moment it is limited to cartesian\r\ncoordinates (a logarithmic scale is possible).\r\n \r\n ![a parabola](http://plot.oettinger-physics.de/graph.php?a0=2&a1=Q%2A1.5&a2=&a3=&a7=1&a8=1&a9=1&b0=250&b1=250&b2=-5&b3=5&b4=-5&b5=5&b6=10&b7=10&b8=5&b9=5&c0=3&c1=0&c2=1&c3=1&c4=1&c5=&c6=1&c7=0&c8=0&c9=0&d0=1&d1=20&d2=20&d3=0&d4=&d5=&d6=&d7=&d8=&d9=&e0=&e1=&e2=&e3=x%5E2-2&e4=ffffff&e5=ffffff&e6=141414&e7=f2f2f2&e8=0&e9=0&f0=0&f1=1&f2=1&f3=0&f4=0&f5=&f6=&f7=&f8=&f9=&g0=&g1=1&g2=1&g3=0&g4=0&g5=0&g6=Y&g7=ff8000&g8=a0b0c0&g9=6080a0&h0=2&z)\r\n this is a png image created dynamically by my plotter.\r\n\r\n ### Why and how\r\n plotter was created because I'm lazy - I wanted the possibility to do quick and (more or less) painless plots of functions\r\n to use in some advanced maths lectures.\r\n\r\n To run a plotter, a webserver with PHP >= 4.3 and an enabled GD-Extension is required.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
