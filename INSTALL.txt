Installing plotter
------------------

1. get the package

2. Unzip the package in the desired location in your webspace. Copy or
   rename the configuration file config.inc.default to config.inc.
   Edit the config file to suit your needs - there is only one step that is
   absolutely necessary:
   - set the value fqdn to the address where yout plotter will be located, e.g.
     $fqdn = theplotterthingy.example.com

  Navigate to the address set as $fqdn and you should be able to see a shiny
  new plot of a standard parabola.

Optional: set up a url shortening service to polish plotters dynamically
