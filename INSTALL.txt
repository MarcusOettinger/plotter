Plotter,
a function plotter (mostly) to display curves of mathematical expressions (mostly),
loosely based on openPlaG (see http://rechneronline.de/openPlaG/) by Juergen Kummer (GPLed).

0. Requirements
---------------
The bare minimum to run a plotter is a webserver with PHP>=4.3 (that is
untested) and the GD extension enabled. At least some packages of GD as
an apache extension (cli and module) were shipped without antialiasing support
compiled in - never mind, if you can live without this feature, there's a
workaround built in.

That's it.


1. Installing plotter
-----------------------

Clone the repository or grab a package. The latest version can always be found
on github:
   https://github.com/MarcusOettinger/plotter

Unzip if needed and copy the contents in the desired location of your webspace.
Copy or rename the default configuration file config.inc.default to a new config.inc.
Edit the config file to suit your needs - there is only one step that is absolutely
necessary:

    set $fqdn to the address where your plotter will be located, e.g.
    $fqdn = theplotterthingy.example.com

Navigate to the address set as $fqdn and you should be able to see a shiny
new plot of a standard parabola.


2. Using an URL shortening Service
----------------------------------

Every image generated by plotter can be reproduced on the fly using the
location of graph.php and a querystring (all relevant information is stored
in there). If used in an E-Mail, whatsapp, tweet or any other text-based
format, this URL is way too long and ugly. That's why the possibility to use
an URL-shortening service was built in.

Currently, two such services can be used:

 * tinyurl: its API works without authentication, so you can always call
   http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php to shorten your links anonymously. 
   Configure your plotter to shorten links via tinyurl by uncommenting the
   following lines in config.inc:

      $shorten = "http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=";
      include_once("short_tinyurl.inc");

 * YOURLS is a URL-shortening service you can run by yourself. You can get
   it and install according to the documentation there at http://yourls.org.
   If you already have a running YOURLS installation working with a secret key
   of XXXX, use it in plotter by uncommenting and changing the lines (you
   don't want an URL shortener working anonymously. Really, you don't!)

      $secret = "XXXX"
      $shorten = "http://YetAnotherYourls.example.com/yourls-api.php?action=shorturl&signature=".$secret."&url=";

There is the possibility to set a piece of text that will be displayed in one
of the info boxes by changing the string
   $short_msg = "Alternatively, use the short link provided below";
